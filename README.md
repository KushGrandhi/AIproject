<h2 align= "left"><b>Problem Statement</b></h2>
The internet is a great place, Information being shared in a matter of seconds, almost an infinite amount of knowledge and billions of people connected worldwide. The internet allows people of similar interests to come together and share their interests and opinions, while people can hide behind an alias. This anonymity is a double edged sword. People can abuse it to be...... "not so friendly" with others. 

Our project was infuenced by the ideas presented in the following research paper by Andrea Perera and Pumudu Fernando from the Informatics Institute of Technology, Colombo.
